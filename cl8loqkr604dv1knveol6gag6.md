## What Consistency looks like.

Started last week with a lot of ginger to keep learning and complete my assigned tasks but damn the work is a lot, I'm not going to lie 💆‍♀‍. Remember I ended last week’s gist telling you of the work load ahead of me, you've not read it? 😒 nawa oh, [check here](https://seyiprisca.hashnode.dev/call-me-author). Back to todays gist, well your girl was overwhelmed a bit because it looked like the tasks wouldn’t finish and I saw small shege in the hand of one bug like this😰, but google and stack overflow held my hand to go past it, ***‘bug got nothing on me💃’.***

To the tasks for the week, well, just a part of it😉. I worked on a COVID dataset, got the data from [Ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and used SQL server for my analysis and tableau for my visualization.

Follow the SQL analysis [here](https://github.com/seyiprisca/Rollademy-projects/blob/main/COVIDPortfolioProject.sql). While working on the dataset, I got a better understanding of using sql join,using CAST and CTE (common table expression). I also stumbled on ‘***bigint’***  for large dataset when working with *‘cast’.*

Moving on to visualization with Tableau, I created a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/priscilla.abimbola/viz/CovidDashboard_16642933578910/Dashboard1) which I tried to make live. Interacting with the dashboard is easy, try playing around the **percentage population infected** graph, by checking for other countries other than the ones currently specified on the graph. It was also a good learning experience using the forecast and geographic role function. 

So far, consistency is making my learning curve easier, thanks to rollademymentorship pressing my neck with tasks😑, check-ins, and encouraging words to keep pushing😊.

 I’ll keep you posted on how the rest of my task goes and how I am navigating my data journey. 
🤫 Hey come closer, I joined a team to work on datathon for Datafest as the only female team member. Trust me to tell you how that goes.

Till later, cheers🙋‍♀‍.
