## My data science journey so far...

I will like to describe my relationship with data science as an on and off affair. I picked up interest in data science 2018 ending and started learning python for data science but stopped after a couple of bugs and frustration, plus it was a little confusing at the time differentiaiting data science from data analytics as their tools were somewhat similar, so a girl took a break.

Fast forward to 2022, our love resurfaced and i decided it was time to nurture it and see how far we'll go together. So i signed up for the *Google data analytics certification course*, got reviews about it being a good start. Got my hands on a couple of datacamp courses too coutesy of ***Ingressive4good*** and lets just say our love got better with these resources. I have completed the certification course alongside the capstone projects and the ***"what next"*** question was starring me in the face. 

As fate would have it, i was casually scrolling through the streets of Twitter on a beautiful Tuesday morning and came across a tweet from @rasheedahoba on a mentorship opportunity by the Rollademy for data science enthusiast, you can bet i hopped on the train. Having people hold my hand as i navigate this data science path will make my journey a lot easier. The mentorship group offers courses, support, projects, assignments that will give you the right knowledge and portfolio required to land a job despite not having prior experience in the field. Its been less than 72hrs with the team, and i can already tell i made a good decision to join rollademy.  

The course load seems a lot at the start but approaching it in bits maks it a lot easier. Currently navigating the introductory course to data science that explains the difference between data analytics, data science and big data. It also covers the tools needed and the mathematical and statistical aspect of data science. My take home from this course is that the real value of data science is in its story, analysis alone doesnt exume great value. So to be a good data scientist, outside of the technical and coding expertise, the art of story telling makes the difference.

I look forward to more courses and projects and i will definately keep you posted. 



For now, cheers.
